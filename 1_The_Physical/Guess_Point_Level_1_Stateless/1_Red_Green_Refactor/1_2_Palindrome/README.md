# Palindrome checker (#palindromeChecker)

> Create a palindrome checker that should be able to detect that a string is a palindrome; that is, it is the same word or phrase in reverse. This means that words like "mom" and "wow" palindromes. It also means that words like "bill" are not palindromes. It should still know that something is a palindrome, even if the casing is off (that means that "Mom" is still a palindrome). Lastly, it should also be able to detect palindromes in phrases like "Was It A Rat I Saw" and "Never Odd or Even" too.

### Requirements 
- GOAL: it should detect that a string is a palindrome
- it should detect that the palindrome checker is defined
- it should detect that "mom" is a palindrome
- it should detect that "wow" is a palindrome
- it should detect that "bill" is not a palindrome
- it should detect that "Mom" is a palindrome and ignore the case 
- it should detect that phrases with spaces like "Was It A Rat I Saw" are a palindrome
- it should detect that phrases with spaces like "Never Odd or Even" are a palindrome
